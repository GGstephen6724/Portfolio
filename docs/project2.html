                    This repository, Urban Micros, shows off the skills and interest of a passionate microgreen grower. This was my personal business idea where I would grow microgreens 
                    and sell them to local restaurants, farmers markets, and maybe even a couple grocery stores. Unfortunately, i'm currently NOT running this business, although this is
                    one of my first websites I've made that I actually impressed myself with at the time. Although it's incomplete, I still feel that this is a perfect respresentation of
                    "You gotta start somewhere". In this project; I started somewhere, kept it going for a bit, then just got bored and uninterested. Regardless of the negativity, this
                    development tought me a lot and shaped me to become a better developer.
                </p>

                    I forgot to mention, this website includes practice with creating and styling tables, responsive design, hover animations, working contact form with php, and links
                    to social media.
